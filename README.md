# Healthcare-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI
This project is an end‑to‑end Healthcare Analysis Dashboard built for hospital administration teams to track doctors, patients, revenue, and expenses in a single interactive view. It combines SQL for data extraction and transformation with Power BI for intuitive visual analytics.
